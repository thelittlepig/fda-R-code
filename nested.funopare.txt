# Performs nonparametric functional regression of a sample of contaminated curves when 
# a categorical response is observed (supervised classification). 
# Nested kernel estimators are implemented : one for the denoising step
# and one for the nonparametric functional discrimination. 
# The estimating algorithm selects automatically two smoothing parameters 
# (one for the denoising step and one for the nonparametric functional 
# discrimination step) by minimizing the k-fold cross-validation (the 
# original dataset is split into "kfold" blocks or subsamples).
# Remark: the measurements where the contaminated curves are observed must be   
#         systematically the same (and equispaced) for the whole sample
#    "Responses" vector containing the categorical responses
#              giving the group number for each curve in 
#              the matrix CONTAMINATED_CURVES (if nbclass is the number of 
#              groups, "Responses" contains numbers 1,2,...,nbclass)
#    "CONTAMINATED_CURVES" matrix containing the contaminated curves 
#                          (stored row by row) used for the learning step
#    "..." arguments needed for the call of the function computing 
#          the semi-metric between curves
#    "semimetric" character string allowing to choose the function 
#                 computing the semimetric;  you can select 
#                 "deriv" (default), "fourier", "hshift", "mplsr", 
#                 and "pca"
#    "nbbwsmooth" size of the bandwidths set used for selecting the optimal
#                 for the denoising step (= 20 by default)
#    "bw.adjust" logical value; if bw.adjust = T then the bandwidths used 
#                in the denoising step are proportionnal to the standard deviation
#                derived from the predictors observed at the measurement 
#                where the kernel smoother is computed (by default bw.adjust = F)
#    "kfold" integer giving the number of folds in the k-fold cross validation
# Returns a list containing:
#    "method" character string giving the mehod type (i.e. "regression")
#    "args" list containing called arguments necessary to compute prediction with the "predict.npfda" function
#    "Estimated.values" vector containing estimated responses 
#                       for each curve of "CONTAMINATED_CURVES"
#    "DENOISED_CURVES" matrix containing the denoised curves (stored row by row)
#    "knn" optimal number of nearest neighbours in the regression step
#    "Bandwidths" vector translating the optimal number of nearest neighbours in terms of 
#                 bandwidths for each curve in the matrix "CONTAMINATED_CURVES" (regression step)
#    "bws" optimal bandwidth used in the denoisiing step
#    "rmse" k-fold relative mean squared errors
